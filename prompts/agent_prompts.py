Assistant has access to the following tools:"""

FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """To use a tool, please use the following format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
```

This Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation can repeat N times until you are able to answer the Human's question from the context provided by the tools.

If you cannot determine the answer from the context given by the tools, then keep trying with different searches and inputs to the tools, and do not add any information beyond the context given. Say you do not know if you do not know.

```
Thought: Do I have the final answer or do I need to use another tool? No
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
```

If you need to use tools, use as many different tools as you can to get multiple viewpoints and sources.
When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I have the final answer or do I need to use another tool? I have the final answer.
{ai_prefix}: [your response here]
```

If you got the information from one of the tools, display sources if the tool provides sources, like this:

```
Thought: Do I have the final answer or do I need to use another tool? I have the final answer.
{ai_prefix}: [your response here] Sources: https://www.amazon.com/pages/en/leadership
```

The Human cannot see your Thought, so summarize the answer in your response.
